# Interest of Content
Minimal interest in the content, it is mainly Lorem Ipsum filler text.
2/10

# Quality of Visual Presentation
Some of the content is acceptable, but there are very few images; those images that are there are misaligned.
4/10

# Quality of Written Presentation
The actual content is very poor, but the presentation is acceptable. If the content were replaced with actual content instead of filler then the quality would improve.
5/10

# Validity of HTML
HTML is mostly valid, with some style info included (which could have been ported to an external CSS file)
7/10

# Evidence of Collaboration
Good evidence of collaboration, with many github pushes and pulls over the week.
Best practice would be to put the author information at the bottom of the page as well.
A large number of commits were pushed an hour before the deadline!
